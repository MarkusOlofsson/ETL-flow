Data Engineering Assignment

Short Summary:

Step 1: Generate temperature data from your computer. By running a Python script, a JSON file with temperature readings will be created.

Step 2: While the first script is running, send the data to Azure Queue Storage. Logic Apps will retrieve the data from the queue, parse the JSON, and insert it into a SQL database. This process will be fully automated from the moment the Python script starts.

Step 3: Visualize the data using tools such as Power BI, Grafana, or a website built with Flask.
